# blog-hub
## Purpose
This portfolio project showcases what I learned during a DevOps course. I created a database for a site that houses many blogs, allowing users to create blogs, make posts, have followers, like posts, and allow comments.


This project showcases the following:
- [x] A Postgres database and the Django application that interacts with the database
- [x] Docker Compose
- [x] Cloud deployment
